# m5-forecasting
The goal of this notebook is to predict timeseries data from the M5 forcasting competition using the dynamic mode decomposition

## M5 Compeition
The M5 competition was a timeseries forcasting competition held in 2020, with the objective of advancing the theory and practice of time series forcasting methods. The M5 data made available by Walmart consists of the unit sales of 3049 products sold across ten stores over 1941 days. The goal is to predict the unit sales of products at each store 28 days ahead.

## Dynamic Mode Decomposition
The dynamic mode decomposition is a dimensionality reduction algorithm which was developed by Peter Schmid in 2008.
